## About me

I'm an innovative technical writer and technical program manager, specializing in process development, cross-team leadership, customer advocacy, and empowering developers to do more.

I've had the opportunity to develop new programs, implement process improvements, and author a range of technical content for some of the largest technology companies. Additionally, I've had the privilege to contribute to the development and administration of Bluetooth technology standards that are integrated into billions of products around the world.

My goal for any position is to drive impact across the organization and delight customers (internal and external) through effective project management and content experiences. My ability to lead and collaborate with teams across disciplines enables me to build trust and deliver results. I bring energy and optimism to solving complex problems and love encouraging others to do the same.

Does the above read a little dry? Yeah, it's my professional intro. But, that's the purpose of this site, so I am going to keep it :). I look forward to meeting if you're reading this!

## Recommendations
To demonstrate my impact, influence, and skills, I have included the following recommendations from previous managers and colleagues that were provided via **[my Linkedin profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jason-nydegger/)**.

#### [John Link](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnmlink/) (previous manager at Microsoft)

I hired Jason into our team at Microsoft to drive clarity and organization into the backlog of contractual documentation required by a large government project we were driving. 

I got what I was looking for - and so much more:
* Jason was clearly much more than a Technical Writer right from the start. He was a true Program Manager as well, organizing the team, driving execution across groups, and providing clarity in a very complex project.
* I also greatly appreciated the way he constantly went beyond what was required in his role and commitments. He had a vision for how to uplevel the documentation across our greater Mixed Reality portfolio, and proposed ways in which we could make improvements that would have broad impact.
* And above all else - Jason was a great team member and human being, showing up with a positive attitude at all times in what could be a very stressful program.

I'm very glad I got to work alongside Jason for time that I did - and would very much like to do so again.

#### [Brandon Brown](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brandonbrown42/) (previous manager at UiPath)

I hired Jason during my time at UiPath. Absolutely outstanding and A-team member. Truly cares about the experience of the user and technical enough to build out his own solutions for how-to guides. Would find/report product bugs when he found them and help improve the experience overall. He uplifted the quality, approach, and overall experience of our docs that set new standards for others to follow long after he left. His technical background gives him an edge to understand concepts quickly and knows how to work with PM/Eng to get whats needed to fill the gaps. Beyond being highly competent, Jason's has a calm under pressure demeanor and a genuine good guy to work with. Would hire him agin in a heart beat given the chance.

#### [Monte Holyfield](https://www.linkedin.com/in/monteholyfield/) (previous teammate at Microsoft)

Simply stated, Jason is the kind of person you want on your team! In addition to Jason's professional, productive and pleasant demeanor, he brings skill and passion to enable others to execute with efficiency and clarity. Jason is a visionary leader with all of the key skills and experience that make him an effective PM. I especially appreciate Jason's communication style and his keen ability to organize and motivate cross functional teams to achieve great impact!

#### [Patrick Nielson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/patnielsen/) (previous teammate at Microsoft)

I had the absolute joy and pleasure to with Jason all through last year (2022). When the Microsoft layoffs happened and he was part of that I was devastated. Jason is impeccable in his work ethic, rock solid in his technical skillset, and one of the finest team players I have ever known. 

Now let me get specific. 

To begin, Jason is a fine writer. He writes with precision and completeness. He is thorough in his editing, and understands how to appeal to any technical audience. He also has mastery of the tools needed for any team and any team's demands and needs. 

Second, Jason understands projects and how projects run and operate. He knows the ins and outs of what to do, how to do it, and what it takes to deliver. He is thorough in his thinking and strategy with a fierce attention to detail. He is patient and knows the right questions to ask for success. 

Finally, and more importantly than all the above, Jason has a sound understanding of the invaluable soft skills of empathy, honesty, transparency, team work, and work ethic. He is completely reliable in all aspects of team projects and team goals. He will always be there to fill in the gaps and pick up any slack. Jason also has a delightful personality and is always approachable with any topic that is needed to discuss.

I highly recommend Jason Nydegger for any project, for any team, for any writing assignment no matter how vast or complex. He will never let you down, and always exceed every expectation and requirement. 

Respectfully, 

Pat Nielsen

#### [Greg Miller](https://www.linkedin.com/in/greg-miller-2391982/) (previous teammate at Amazon)

I worked with Jason on building resources to help new software engineers understand Amazon's development tool suite. He did a great job of putting together the right content and getting a solid group of reviewers together to make sure we were delivering what our target audience needed. We released his content to positive feedback and it is still a valuable resource today!

#### [Matt Druyos](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matt-druyos/) (previous teammate at Microsoft)

What struck me most about working with Jason is his willingness to step in and tackle any problem effectively, whether or not it was within his comfort zone. During my time working with him, his contributions were critical to the health of the organization, from team leadership and scope management to traceability and technical writing. Jason is an excellent all-around leader who is demonstrably capable of driving impact at all levels of the organization. In addition to being technically capable for anything thrown his way, he is also an excellent communicator and very fun to work with. I sincerely hope our paths cross again!

Jason is a fantastic tech writer and his previous experience as an engineer is evident in his work. His attention to details and ability to translate engineering plans, designs and reports to high quality technical written deliverables and do it well is a rare skill to have, and Jason has it! Jason embraces the mantra as a team player and partner and is extremely trustworthy in getting his commitments done on time and of very high quality. Highly recommend that if you are able to have Jason on your team as a resource or are able to work with Jason as a partner you take the opportunity to. Thank you for the momentum and positive energy that you brought to my team and the program as a whole.

#### [Andre Campos](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andre-campos-75813b2a/) (previous teammate at Microsoft)

Jason parachuted into my project in a time of extreme changes and uncertainty. He methodically pealed away the layers of complexity until he got to the core of the problem and efficiently identified key stakeholders to gather the data he needed to build the required solution. Not only he got us on the right path, he also paved the way for how to keep us on track moving forward.

#### [Henry Lee](https://www.linkedin.com/in/henrylee206/) (previous teammate at Microsoft)

It was a pleasure to work daily with Jason. He brought a strong technical acumen and enthusiasm that pushed the technical documentation program to a higher standard. Jason is a very easy person to work with. Always responsive to your questions and always willing to help others with their documentation needs. He will be truly missed and Iâ€™m disappointed he was impacted by the economic environment. I wholeheartedly endorse his character and technical writing abilities.

#### [Clark Denison](https://www.linkedin.com/in/clarkdenison/) (previous teammate at Microsoft)

Jason led the documentation development for our defense product and did so with magical results. The cybersecurity documentation is detailed and extensive. It required collaboration across multiple engineering teams and disciplines. Jason led the collection effort, thought of new ways communicate this information, and anticipated 3rd party auditors' questions. He did all of this professionally.

Jason - Thank you for all of your hard work and support!

#### [Leann MacMillan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/leannmacmillan/) (previous teammate at Microsoft)

I've been working with Jason in his role as technical writer and highly recommend him for any technical writing or program management position. His strengths include technical background, solid judgement in understanding context the customer needs, and ability to work across team silos to complete projects on time. He listens to issues being raised, and is extremely helpful in providing clarity when needed. Most recently, I worked with Jason during the creation of a product performance specification where we also needed to provide traceability of requirements to our customer. The outcomes in documentation and requirements processes were outstanding. It's been such a pleasure to work with Jason not only because he is very talented, skilled and professional, but also because he is kind and personable. I will miss working with him, and truly hope our career paths cross again some day. I am so proud of the work we did together.
